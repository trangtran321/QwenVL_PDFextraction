The main reason is that the expansion operator does remove all elements in Ra | \u03c8 when (M, s) |= \u00acBa\u00ac\u03c8. Thus, only one direction could be satisfied.6.1 A R-Operator that Satisfies DP2Let *C be a mapping from interpretations to interpretations that satisfies the following conditions that satisfies the following conditions\u2022 u *C \u03c8 |= \u03c6 if \u03c6 \u2227 \u03c8 is consistent and u |= \u03c6;\u2022 u *C \u03c6 = u *C (\u03c6 \u2227 \u03c8) if \u03c6 \u2227 \u03c8 is consistent and u |= \u03c6;\u2022 (u *C \u03c6) *C \u03c8 = u *C \u03c8 if \u03c8 \u2192 \u03c6 and u |= \u03c8 \u2192 \u03c6.For an agent a \u2208 A, we define \u03a3a(\u03c6), called an event-model for revision of B\u03b1\u03c6, as the event model (\u03a3, {Ea}a\u2208A, pre, sub) where \u03a3 = {\u03c3, \u03c4, \u03b5} and\u2022 Ea = {(\u03c3, \u03c4), (\u03c4, \u03b5), (\u03b5, \u03b5)};\u2022 Ex = {(\u03c3, \u03b5), (\u03c4, \u03b5), (\u03b5, \u03b5)} for x \u2208 A  {a};\u2022 pre(\u03c3) = pre(\u03b5) = pre(\u03c4) = T;\u2022 sub(\u03c3) = sub(\u03b5) = \u2205 and sub(\u03c4) is defined via *C.Definition 4. Let (M, s) be a pointed Kripke structur \u03c6 be a fluent literal. The event based revision operator * of a revision of B\u03b1\u03c6 in (M, s) is defined by(M, s) *B\u03b1\u03c6 = (M, s) \u2297 (\u03a3a(\u03c6), {\u03c3})In the following, we will we discuss several revision operator indeed satisfies several AGM+DP postulates. Before we discuss them in details, let us assume that K is represented by (M, s). We will also refer to (M, s) *B\u03b1\u03c6 as (M\u03c6, s\u03c6) where s\u03c6 = (s, \u03c3) andM\u03c6 = (W\u03c6, {Rx}x\u2208A, \u03c0\u03c6) when no confusion is possible and assume that M = (W, {Rx}x\u2208A, \u03c0). Successive revisions such as (K * B\u03b1\u03c6) *B\u03b1\u03c8 will be denoted by ((M\u03c6)\u03c8, (s\u03c6)\u03c8) etc. We first prove that beliefs of other agents do not change.Lemma 7. For every agent x \u2208 A  {a} and a fluent formula \u03c8, (M\u03c6, s\u03c6) |= Bx\u03c8 iff (M, s) |= Bx\u03c8.Proof. By the construction of (M\u03c6, s\u03c6), we have that s\u03c6 = (s, \u03c3). Furthermore, (u, e) \u2208 W\u03c6 for every u \u2208 W and ((s, \u03c3), (u, e)) \u2208 R\u03b1\u03c6 iff (s, u) \u2208 Ra. Therefore, (M\u03c6, s\u03c6) |= Bx\u03c8 iff (M, s) |= Bx\u03c8. \u25a1Closure By our definition, it is clear thatK * B\u03b1\u03c6 = Cn(K * B\u03b1\u03c6).Inclusion Due to Lemma 2 and Lemma 7, it suffices to show that if B\u03b1\u03b7 \u2208 K * B\u03b1\u03c6 then B\u03b1\u03b7 \u2208 K + B\u03b1\u03c6 holds. Assume that K is represented by (M, s). We refer to K + B\u03b1\u03c6 by (M\u2032, s\u2032) as it is defined. By the construction of K + B\u03b1\u03c6, we have that R\u03b1\u03c6((s, \u03c3)) = \u2205, i.e., K + B\u03b1\u03c6 is inconsistent if (M, s) |= \u00acBa\u00ac\u03c6. Thus, the postulate holds trivially. Therefore, we only need to consider the cases that (M, s) |= \u00acBa\u00ac\u03c6.Vacuity It follows from the above proof that Vacuity does not hold for this operator because there exists some B\u03b1\u03c8 \u2208 K + B\u03b1\u03c6 such that B\u03b1\u03c8 \u2209 K * B\u03b1\u03c6. This can happen when Ra | \u00ac\u03c6 \u2260 \u2205, and thus, there exists some (s, \u03c3) \u2208 R\u03b1\u03c6 and \u03c0(u, \u03c3) = \u03c0\u03c6((u, \u03c4)) |= \u03c6. The consistency of Kripke structure in Figure 5, assuming there is no constraints among the propositions, then (M, s) + B\u03b1\u03c6 |= Ba\u00acp while (M, s) *B\u03b1\u03c6 |= Ba\u00acp while (M\u03c8, s\u03c8), i.e., * satisfies this postulate.Consistency Since K and B\u03b1\u03c6 are consistent, R\u03b1(s) \u2260 \u2205 and therefore R\u03b1\u03c6((s, \u03c3)) \u2260 \u2205. Together with Lemma 7, we have that K * B\u03b1\u03c6 is consistency.Extensionality Assume that |= B\u03b1\u03c8 \u2194 B\u03b1\u03c8. This implies that \u03c6 \u2194 \u03c8 and a = b. Assume that K is represented by (M, s). We have that for any u \u2208 W and \u03b7 \u2208 {\u03c3, \u03c4, \u03b5}, (u, \u03b7\u03c6) \u2208 W\u03c6 and (u, \u03b7\u03c8) \u2208 W\u03c8. Furthermore, (((u, \u03b7\u03c6), (v, \u03be\u03c6)) \u2208 R\u03b1\u03c6 iff ((u, \u03b7\u03c6) \u2208 W\u03c6 and (v, \u03be\u03c6)) \u2208 R\u03b1\u03c6. Therefore, (M\u03c6, s\u03c6) |= Bx\u03b7 if and only if (M\u03c8, s\u03c8) |= Bx\u03b7.Superexpansion Consider a fluent formula \u03b7. Lemma 7 shows that K * B\u03b1(\u03c6 \u2227 \u03c8) |= Bx\u03b7 iff (K * B\u03b1\u03c6) + Bx\u03c8 |= Bx\u03b7 for x \u2260 a. So, we just need to prove (K * B\u03b1\u03c6) + Bx\u03c8 |= Bx\u03b7 implies that (K * B\u03b1\u03c6) + Bx\u03c8 |=",

Cn satisfies the following properties: (i) A \u2286 Cn(A); (ii) if A \u2286 B then Cn(A) \u2286 Cn(B); (iii) Cn(A) = Cn(Cn(A)).Cn is assumed to be supraclassical, i.e. if p can be derived from A by classical truth-functional logic, then p \u2208 Cn(A); A is a belief set if and only if A = Cn(A).In what follows, K will denote a belief set, X \u22a2 p is an alternative notation for p \u2208 Cn(X), and X \u22ad p for p \u2209 Cn(X). Cn(\u2205) is the set of tautologies.[MT: In the rest of the paper, should we replace \u22a2 by \u22a8 everywhere else other than when we say (M, s) |= ..., to use different symbols for the two.] The expansion of K by a formula p, i.e. the operation that just adds p and removes nothing, is denoted K + p, and defined as follows: K + p = Cn(K \u222a {p}).2.1 Belief FormulaA multi-agent domain \u27e8A, F\u27e9 includes a finite and non-empty set of agents A and a set of fluents F encoding properties of the world. Belief formulae over \u27e8A, F\u27e9 are defined by the BNF:\u03c6 ::= p | \u00acp | (\u03c6 \u2227 \u03c6) | (\u03c6 \u2228 \u03c6) | Bi\u03c6where \u03c6 \u2208 F is a fluent and i \u2208 A. We also use other standard connectives like \u2192 and \u2194 through their usual abbreviation.Darwiche and Pearl (1997) augmented the AGM framework by four postulates for iterated revision: DPl: if q then K(M + p)q = KMsqDp2: if \u22a2 \u00acp then K(M + p)q = KMsqDp3: if p \u2208 KMsq then p \u2208 K(M + p)qDp4: if \u00acp \u2209 KMsq then \u00acp \u2209 K(M + p)qThe following postulate strengthens DP3 and DP4 (Jin and Thierscher 2007):Independence: if \u00acp \u2209 KMsq then p \u2208 K(M + p)q3 Multi-agent Belief Belief RevisionWe begin by discussing the basic concepts for multi-agent belief revision based on a single, pointed Kripke model representing the beliefs of all agents. Thereafter, we propose generalizations of all the AGM postulates and postulates for iterated revision, including the postulate of Independence.3.1 Basic conceptsBelief SetsA belief set is represented by a single, pointed Kripke structure (M, s) and is the set of all formulae entailed by (M, s):K(M, s) = {\u03c6 \u2208 LA | (M, s) |= \u03c6}Two pointed Kripke structures \u27e8W, {Ra}a\u2208A, \u03c0\u27e9 and \u27e8W\u2032, {R\u2032a}a\u2208A, \u03c0\u2032\u27e9 are bisimilar if for all (w, w\u2032) \u2208 Z:1.

DP1 \u2013 Successive revision respect Suppose B_a\u03c8 is consistent with K, then so is B_a\u03c6 since \u03c8 |= \u03c6. It follows that K *fin B_a\u03c8 |= K *fin B_a\u03c6 and (K *fin B_a\u03c8) *fin B_a\u03c6 |= K *fin B_a\u03c8. The two Kripke structures are bisimilar except for unreachable worlds, hence they entail the same set of belief formulas. (M_\u03c6, s_\u03c6) = (M, s) + B_a\u03c6 contains the worlds W in M plus a replicate W_\u03c6 of these worlds such that a world is a-accessible from s_\u03c6 if, and only if, it is in W_\u03c6 and satisfies \u03c6. (M', s') = (M_\u03c6, s_\u03c6) + B_a\u03c8 contains the worlds W \u222a W_\u03c6 plus a replicate of W_\u03c8 of these worlds such that a world is a-accessible from s_\u03c8 if, and only if, it is in W_\u03c8 and satisfies \u03c8. Suppose B_a\u03c6 is inconsistent with K but B_a\u03c8 is not, then B_a\u03c8 is also inconsistent with K + B_a\u03c6. It follows that (K *fin B_a\u03c6) *fin B_a\u03c8 = K *fin B_a\u03c8. Hence B_a \u00ac\u03c6 \u2209 K *fin B_a\u03c8, thus violating the postulate. DP2 \u2013 Irrelevance of superseded beliefs Generalized full-meet does not satisfy weak DP, for the following reason: If B_b\u03c8 is consistent with the current belief set K then K *fin B_b\u03c8 = K + B_b\u03c8, hence by Lemma 2, all agents retain all their beliefs when revising K set by b's new belief. But if K is revised by B_a\u03c6 first and |= B_b\u03c8 \u2192 B_a\u03c6\u03c6 holds then (K *fin B_b\u03c8) *fin B_b\u03c8 = K *fin B_a\u03c6 + B_b\u03c8, which holds implies that all other agents' beliefs have been erased. The fact that full-meet does not satisfy DP2 mirrors a result in classical, single-agent belief revision (Jin and Thieslsher 2007). For this reason, full-meet multilateral belief revision satisfies only one direction of DP2, namely, revising by a belief that is then superseded by a second, contradictory belief never introduces more beliefs than revision with the second belief directly. To show this, we make a case distinction: 1. Suppose |= \u03c6 \u2194 (M_\u03c6, s) |= pre(\u03c4); hence K *fin B_a\u03c6 = K *fin B_a\u03c6 + B_a\u22a5, that is, there is no a-accessible world in s while all other agents' first-degree beliefs are tautological fluent formulas. Consequently, (K *fin B_a\u03c6) *fin B_a\u03c8 \u2286 K *fin B_b\u03c8.",

The new designated world is linked via a to the replicate of the old Kripke structure (top) and via b to the old Kripke structure itself (bottom). All a-links to \u00acp-worlds have been removed in the replicated part. As a result, a now believes in p (but also still in Ba\u00acp).Proof. By definition of the entailment of formulae from a pointed Kripke structure, if R\u2032a(s\u2032) = \u2205 then (M\u2032, s\u2032) |= Ba\u03c6 and (M\u2032, s\u2032) |= Ba\u00ac\u03c6 for any formula \u03c6. Thus, (M\u2032, s\u2032) |= Ba\u22a5.Assume that R\u2032a(s\u2032) \u2260 \u2205. By construction, for every ur such that (s\u2032, ur) \u2208 R\u2032A, we have that (s, ur) \u2208 RA and \u03c0(ur) |= \u03c6. This implies that \u03c0(ur) |= \u03c6, and thus, (M\u2032, s\u2032) |= Ba\u03c6 because R\u2032a(s\u2032) \u2260 \u2205. The next lemma shows that the first-degree beliefs of agent a are exactly the logical consequences of its old beliefs plus the new belief.Lemma 4. If R\u2032a(s\u2032) \u2260 \u2205 then (M\u2032, s\u2032) |= Ba\u03c8 if, and only if, \u03c8 \u2208 Cn{ {\u03c6} \u222a {\u03c6 \u2208 BA,A,\u22a5 | Ba\u03c6 \u2208 K(M, s)} }.Proof. The proof of this lemma is similar to the proof of Lemma 3 with the observation that for \u03c8 \u2208 Cn{ {\u03c6} \u222a {\u03c6 \u2208 BA,A,\u22a5 | Ba\u03c6 \u2208 K(M, s)} }, (s\u2032, ur) \u2208 R\u2032a and \u03c0(ur) |= \u03c6 iff (s, u) \u2208 Ra and \u03c0(u) |= \u03c8.3.2 Postulates for one-shot multi-agent BRUsing the basic concepts for multi-agent belief sets represented by a single, pointed Kripke structure, we discuss generalizations of the standard postulates, beginning with the AGM postulates for one-shot revision.Closure A revised belief set is deductively closed, denoted by Cn, under the modal belief logic being interpreted as:K * Ba\u03c6 = Cn(K * Ba\u03c6)Since the set of belief formulas entailed by a single, pointed Kripke model is deductively closed, this postulate holds under the assumption that a revised belief set is represented by a pointed Kripke model.Success The result of revising a Kripke model by a first-degree belief formula should include the new belief:Ba\u03c6 \u2208 K * Ba\u03c6Inclusion A revised Kripke model should only contain first-degree belief formulas that are included in the expanded Kripke model:K * Ba\u03c6 \u2286 K + Ba\u03c6From Lemma 2 and 4 it follows that under the Inclusion principle, a revised Kripke model contains only first-degree belief formulae that follow logically from the old and new first-degree beliefs.Our generalized Inclusion postulate does not make any assumptions about second- or higher-degree belief formulae. In particular it allows for another agent, b, to change its beliefs about agent a believing in \u03c6. Hence, K * Ba\u03c6 may contain beliefs that are not included in K + Ba\u03c6 if these are not first-order beliefs.An expansion of a belief set with Ba\u03c6 does not change the first-degree beliefs of other agents.Lemma 2. For any formula \u03c8 and agent x \u2208 A  {a}, (M, s) |= Bx\u03c8 iff (M\u2032, s\u2032) |= Bx\u03c8.Proof. By construction of (M, s) + Ba\u03c6, we have that (s\u2032, u) \u2208 R\u2032x iff (s, u) \u2208 Rx. Therefore, (M, s) |= Bx\u03c8 if (M\u2032, s\u2032) |= Bx\u03c8.Lemma 3. If R\u2032a(s\u2032) = \u2205 then (M\u2032, s\u2032) is inconsistent. If R\u2032a(s\u2032) \u2260 \u2205 then (M\u2032, s\u2032) |= Ba\u22a5, i.e., (M\u2032, s\u2032) |= Ba\u03c6.The next lemma shows that expanding a belief set with Ba\u03c6 can result in a having inconsistent beliefs or believing in \u03c6 as shown in the next lemma.Lemma 3. If R\u2032a(s\u2032) = \u2205 then (M\u2032, s\u2032) is inconsistent. If R\u2032a(s\u2032) \u2260 \u2205 then (M\u2032, s\u2032) |= Ba\u22a5, i.e., (M\u2032, s\u2032) |= Ba\u03c6.",

Formally, K1 |= \u00acBbBb\u00acp whereas K2 |= \u00acBaBa\u00acp.Note that two multi-agent Kripke models that are bisimilar define the same belief set, provided the two designated worlds coincide in their interpretation. Even when the two models are dissimilar, they still induce the same belief set if they entail the same belief formulas from the respective true state of the world.Deductive closure of a belief set We consider the deductive closure of a belief set, Cn(K), w.r.t. entailment relation |=. It follows immediately that any belief set satisfies Cn(K) = K.Consistent beliefs/belief sets Agents can have inconsistent beliefs: By definition, Ba\u22a5 \u2208 K(M, s) if, and only if, Ra(s) = \u2205 in M. Agents can also believe that other agents have inconsistent beliefs etc., but a belief set itself is always consistent because M[\u03c0](s) |=\u22a5 for any pointed Kripke structure. Hence, the concept of consistency in the classical AGM postulates needs to be adapted to consistency of the beliefs of individual agents in the multi-agent setting when representing a belief set by a single Kripke structure.Revision With the aim to model sensing actions in a multi-agent environment, we consider revising belief sets to reflect the result of an agent making an observation about the environment. The belief set after revision by a first-degree belief Ba\u03c6 should again be represented by a single, pointed Kripke structure, denoted by (M, s) * Ba\u03c6. We will simply write K * Ba\u03c6 to refer to the belief set K(M, s) * Ba\u03c6 when it is clear from the context that (M, s) is the underlying Kripke model determining the belief set K.Expansion A key concept in the classical AGM postulates is the expansion of a belief set by a new belief. The intuition behind this concept is to add a new belief while retaining the result of the old and new beliefs, but in a minimal fashion. In order to generalise this concept to multi-agent beliefs given by a pointed Kripke structure, the intuition behind the following formal definition is that K + Ba\u03c6 is obtained by constructing a new structure that's a combination of: (1) M (the old structure); (2) a new true state of the world s\u2032; and (3) a structure that is obtained from M by: (i) removing all links labeled a into a world in which \u03c6 is false, and (ii) links labeled a going from s\u2032 to worlds in which there is a link labeled a.Formally, let M = (W, {Ra}a\u2208A, \u03c0), then expanding a pointed Kripke model (M, s) by a first-degree belief formula results in the pointed Kripke model (M, s) * Ba\u03c6 = (M\u2032, s\u2032) with M\u2032 = (W\u2032, {Ra}a\u2208A, \u03c0\u2032) such that\u2022 W\u2032 = W \u222a Wr \u222a {s\u2032} with Wr = {s | s \u2208 W} \u2013 the replicate of W, where s\u2032 is a new world symbol that does not occur in W \u222a Wr;\u2022 for w \u2208 W and w\u2032 \u2208 {w, w\u2032}, \u03c0\u2032(w\u2032) = \u03c0(w); and \u03c0\u2032(s\u2032) = \u03c0(s);",

By construction, for x \u2208 {\u03c6 \u2227 \u03c8, \u03c8}, s^x = (s, \u03c3^x) and (s^x, u^x) \u2208 R^x_a where u^x = (u, \u03c4^x) iff (s, u) \u2208 R_a. Furthermore, \u03c0^\u03c6\u2227\u03c8(u^\u03c6\u2227\u03c8) = u \u2208 s_C (\u03c6 \u2227 \u03c8) and \u03c0^\u03c8(u^\u03c8) = u \u2217_C \u03c6. This proves the postulate.Subexpansion Similar to the Vacuity postulate, this operator does not satisfy this postulate. The main reason is that when K \u2217 B_a\u03c6 + \u03c8 is consistent then the set of R^\u03c6\u2227\u03c8_a can be a proper superset of R^\u03c6_a, using the same notations as in the previous paragraph.DP1 \u2013 Successive revision respect Since |= B_a\u03c8 \u2192 B_a\u03c6, we have that \u03c8 \u2192 \u03c6 and a and b are identical. Therefore, we will show that * satisfies this postulate by showing that if B_a\u03c8 \u2192 B_a\u03c6 holds then (K \u2217 B_a\u03c6) \u2217 B_a\u03c8 = K \u2217 B_a\u03c8.By construction, x \u2208 (W^\u03c6)\u03c8 has the form ((x, \u03b7^x), \u03b3^x) for \u03b7, \u03b3 \u2208 {\u03c3, \u03c4, \u03b5}. Furthermore, (s^\u03c6)\u03c8 = ((s, \u03c3^\u03c6), \u03c3^\u03c6) and ((s^\u03c6)\u03c8, (u^\u03c6)\u03c8) \u2208 (R^\u03c6)\u03c8_a where (u^\u03c6)\u03c8 = ((u, \u03c4^\u03c6), \u03c4^\u03c6) and u \u2208 W and (\u03c0^\u03c6)\u03c8((u^\u03c6)\u03c8) = \u03c0^\u03c6((u, \u03c4^\u03c6)) \u2217_C \u03c8 = u \u2217_C \u03c6 \u2217_C \u03c8 = u \u2217_C \u03c8 (assumption about \u2217_C) iff (s, u) \u2208 R_a and (s^\u03c6, u^\u03c6) \u2208 R^\u03c6_a where s^\u03c6 = (s, \u03c3^\u03c6) and u^\u03c6 = (u, \u03c4^\u03c6).We have that (s^\u03c6, u^\u03c6) \u2208 R^\u03c6_a iff there exists some u \u2208 W such that (s, u) \u2208 R_a, u^\u03c6 = (u, \u03c4^\u03c6). Because (M^\u03c6)\u03c8 = (s^\u03c6, \u03c3^\u03c6). We have that ((s^\u03c6)\u03c8, (u^\u03c6)\u03c8) \u2208 (R^\u03c6)\u03c8_a iff there exists some u^\u03c6 \u2208 (W^\u03c6)\u03c8 such that (s^\u03c6, u^\u03c6) \u2208 R^\u03c6_a, (u^\u03c6)\u03c8 = (u^\u03c6, \u03c4^\u03c6) and (\u03c0^\u03c6)\u03c8((u^\u03c6)\u03c8)((u^\u03c6)\u03c8) = u^\u03c6 \u2217_C \u03c8, (\u03c0^\u03c6)\u03c8(u^\u03c6) = u \u2217_C \u03c6.By definition, (s^\u03c8)\u03c8 = (s^\u03c6, \u03c3^\u03c6). We have that ((s^\u03c6)\u03c8, (u^\u03c8)\u03c8) \u2208 (R^\u03c6)\u03c8_a iff there exists some u^\u03c8 \u2208 (W^\u03c6)\u03c8 such that (s^\u03c6, u^\u03c8) \u2208 R^\u03c6_a, (u^\u03c8)\u03c8 = (u^\u03c8, \u03c4^\u03c8) and (\u03c0^\u03c6)\u03c8(\u03c4^\u03c8)(u^\u03c8) = u^\u03c8 \u2217_C \u03c8 = u \u2217_C \u03c6 = u \u2217_C \u03c8 = \u03c0^\u03c8(\u03c4^\u03c8)(u^\u03c8) = u \u2217_C \u03c6.The above concludes that (K \u2217 B_a\u03c6) \u2217 B_a\u03c8 = K \u2217 B_a\u03c8.DP2 \u2013 Irrelevance of superseded beliefs B_a\u03c8 |= \u00acB_a\u03c6 implies that a = b and \u03c8 \u2192 \u03c6. As such, we need to show that B_a\u03c8 |= \u00acB_a\u03c6 \u2192 (K \u2217 B_a\u03c6) \u2217 B_a\u03c8 = K \u2217 B_a\u03c8.By construction, (s^\u03c6)\u03c8 = (s^\u03c6, \u03c3^\u03c6). We have that ((s^\u03c6)\u03c8, (u^\u03c8)\u03c8) \u2208 (R^\u03c6)\u03c8_a iff there exists some u^\u03c8 \u2208 (W^\u03c6)\u03c8 such that (s^\u03c6, u^\u03c8) \u2208 R^\u03c6_a, (u^\u03c8)\u03c8 = (u^\u03c8, \u03c4^\u03c8) and (\u03c0^\u03c6)\u03c8(\u03c4^\u03c8)((u^\u03c8)\u03c8) = u^\u03c8 \u2217_C \u03c8, (\u03c0^\u03c6)\u03c8(u^\u03c8) = u \u2217_C \u03c6.The proof for this postulate follows from Lemma 7 and the Success postulate for a \u2260 b. If a = b, it means that we need to show that B_a\u03c6 \u2208 K \u2217 B_a\u03c8 |= B_a\u03c6 \u2208 (K \u2217 B_a\u03c6) \u2217 B_a\u03c8. This is obvious because B_a\u03c6 \u2217 B_a\u03c8 is consistent. A similar argument to that in the proof of DP1 shows that B_a\u03c6 \u2208 (K \u2217 B_a\u03c6) \u2217 B_a\u03c8.DP4 \u2013 Minimal change when reaffirming a belief Clearly, this should be considered only if a \u2260 b. B_a\u00ac\u03c6 \u2209 K \u2217 B_a\u03c8 implies that there exists some (s, u) \u2208 R_a such that u \u2217_C \u03c6 |= \u03c6. By construction of K \u2217 B_a\u03c8, this means that u |= \u03c6. This implies that u \u2217_C \u03c6 = u. Thus, there exists some (u^\u03c6)\u03c8 \u2208 (W^\u03c6)\u03c8 such that (((s^\u03c6)\u03c8, (u^\u03c6)\u03c8) \u2208 (R^\u03c6)\u03c8_a and (u^\u03c6)\u03c8 |= \u03c6. This proves the postulate.Independence Lemma 7 guarantees that B_a\u03c6 \u2208 (K \u2217 B_a\u03c8) \u2217 B_a\u03c8 if a \u2260 b. When s = b, the condition B_a\u00ac\u03c6 \u2209 K \u2217 B_a\u03c8 implies that \u03c6 \u2227 \u03c8 is consistent. Therefore, for every (u^\u03c6)\u03c8 \u2208 (W^\u03c6)\u03c8 such that (((s^\u03c6)\u03c8, (u^\u03c6)\u03c8) \u2208 (R^\u03c6)\u03c8_a and (u^\u03c6)\u03c8 |= \u03c6. This proves the postulate.7 Discussion ReferencesAlchourr\u00f3n, C. E., and Makinson, D. 1982. On the logic of theory change: Contraction functions and their associated revision functions.

We have that for any u \u2208 W and \u03b7 \u2208 {\u03c3, \u03c4, \u03b4, \u03b3, \u03b5}, (u, \u03b7i) \u2208 Wi iff (u, \u03b72) \u2208 W2 because \u03c0(u) |= \u03c6 and (M, u) |= Ba\u03c6 iff \u03c0(u) |= \u03c8 and (M, u) |= Ba\u03c8 as \u03c6 \u2194 \u03c8 and Ba\u03c6 \u2194 Ba\u03c8.

The proof is then similar to the second subcase of the previous case.[ST: Might be used for space saving: We omit the detailed proof for brevity.

In this case, (s2, u2) \u2208 R2a. This shows that K * Ba\u03c6 + Ba\u03c8 |= Ba\u03b7, which, together with Lemma 3, shows that (K * Ba\u03c6) + Ba\u03c8 |= Ba\u03b7, which concludes the postulate.Subexpansion The proof of this postulate is similar to the proof of Superexpansion where we show that, under the assumption that Ba\u00ac\u03c8 \u0338\u2208 K * Ba\u03c6 + Ba\u03c8, which eliminates the cases where a is inconsistent in K * Ba\u03c6 + Ba\u03c8 (Case 3(a) and 4(a)) with the following remark: in the remaining cases, we have that (s2, u2) \u2208 R2a iff (s1, u1) \u2208 Ra and \u03c02(u2) = \u03c01(u1).[ST: In addition to the conclusion that ((s, \u03b72), (u, \u03c12)) \u2208 R2a if ((s, \u03b71), (u, \u03c11)) \u2208 R1a, it also holds that ((s, \u03b71), (u, \u03c11)) \u2208 Ra and (s2, u2) \u2208 R2a where u2 = (u, \u03c32) iff (s, u) \u2208 Ra and \u03c0(u) |= \u03c6. In either case, (s2, u2) \u2208 R2a. This helps prove the postulate.]DP1 \u2013 Successive revision respect Since |= Ba\u03c8 \u2192 Ba\u03c6, we have that \u03c8 \u2192 \u03c6 and a and b are identical. Therefore, we will show that * satisfies this postulate by showing that * |= Ba\u03c8 \u2192 Ba\u03c6 holds then (K * Ba\u03c6) * Ba\u03c8 = K * Ba\u03c6. Assume that (M, s) satisfies K. Let us denote with \u03a31 and \u03a32 the event model \u03a32(\u03c6) and \u03a32(\u03c8), respectively. Let (M0, s0) = (M, s) * Ba\u03c6, (M1, s1) = (M0, s0) * Ba\u03c8, and (M2, s2) = (M, s) * Ba\u03c8. Furthermore, M1 = {Wr, {Ra}x\u2208A, \u03c0}. Again, we will need to consider four cases, similar to the proof of Success, following the structure of \u03a32(\u03c8).1. (M, s) |= \u03c8 \u2227 \u00acBa\u00ac\u03c8. In this case, s2 = (s, \u03c32) and \u00acBa\u00ac\u03c8 \u2227 Ba\u03c6 \u2227 Ba\u00ac\u03c6 \u2227 Ba\u03c8. Therefore, s2 = (s, \u03c32) and (s2, u2) \u2208 R2a where u2 = (u, \u03c32) iff (s, u) \u2208 Ra and \u03c0(u) |= \u03c6. Furthermore, M2 = {Wr, {Ra}x\u2208A, \u03c0}. This means that for every u2 such that (s2, u2) \u2208 R2a, we have that (s2, u2) \u2208 R2a where u2 = (u, \u03c32) iff (s, u) \u2208 Ra and \u03c0(u) |= \u03c6. Similar to the first case, we can conclude that the postulate is correct.2. (M, s) |= \u00ac\u03c8 \u2227 \u00acBa\u00ac\u03c8. In this case, s2 = (s, \u03c32) and \u00acBa\u00ac\u03c8 \u2227 Ba\u03c6 \u2227 Ba\u00ac\u03c6 \u2227 Ba\u03c8. Therefore, s2 = (s, \u03c32) and (s2, u2) \u2208 R2a where u2 = (u, \u03c32) iff (s, u) \u2208 Ra and \u03c0(u) |= \u03c6. Furthermore, M2 = {Wr, {Ra}x\u2208A, \u03c0}. This means that for every u2 such that (s2, u2) \u2208 R2a, we have that (s2, u2) \u2208 R2a where u2 = (u, \u03c32) iff (s, u) \u2208 Ra and \u03c0(u) |= \u03c6. Similar to the first case, we can conclude that the postulate is correct.3. (M, s) |= \u00ac\u03c8 \u2227 Ba\u00ac\u03c6. In this case, s2 = (s, \u03c32) and (s2, u2) \u2208 R2a where u2 = (u, \u03c32) iff (s, u) \u2208 Ra and \u03c0(u) |= \u03c6. Furthermore, M2 = {Wr, {Ra}x\u2208A, \u03c0}. This means that for every u2 such that (s2, u2) \u2208 R2a, we have that (s2, u2) \u2208 R2a where u2 = (u, \u03c32) iff (s, u) \u2208 Ra and \u03c0(u) |= \u03c6. Similar to the first case, we can conclude that the postulate is correct.4. (M, s) |= \u00ac\u03c8 \u2227 Ba\u03c6. In this case, s2 = (s, \u03c32) and (s2, u2) \u2208 R2a where u2 = (u, \u03c32) iff (s, u) \u2208 Ra and \u03c0(u) |= \u03c6. Furthermore, M2 = {Wr, {Ra}x\u2208A, \u03c0}. This means that for every u2 such that (s2, u2) \u2208 R2a, we have that (s2, u2) \u2208 R2a where u2 = (u, \u03c32) iff (s, u) \u2208 Ra and \u03c0(u) |= \u03c6. Similar to the first case, we can conclude that the postulate is correct.",
